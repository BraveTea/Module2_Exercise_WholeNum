# Module2_Exercise_WholeNum
an exercise to make me realise the difference between a primitve and a reference type. 
Because a var that is assigned a primitive type merely copies the contents of the memory location
  you can't change it with this code. 
 Because val2 is a reference type, which copies the handle to and not the value in, 
   the memory I am able to edit the value and update it to the new value.
